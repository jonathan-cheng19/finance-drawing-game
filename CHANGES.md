# Changes Made - October 30, 2025

## Summary
Updated the PPM Pictionary game with new features, improved UI/UX, and fixed hosting configuration.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Game Configuration (6 Rounds)
- **File**: `server/config/gameConfig.js`
- Changed from 3 rounds to 6 rounds total
- 2 rounds of each difficulty level (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)

- Each round config now includes difficulty level

### 2. Correct Guess Overlay
- **Files**: `client/src/App.jsx`, `client/src/components/GameBoard.jsx`, `client/src/components/GameBoard.css`
- Added green overlay that appears when a player guesses correctly
- Displays "âœ“ CORRECT!" in large green text
- Shows player name and points earned
- Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
- Includes bounce-in animation

### 3. Auto-Transition Logic
- **File**: `server/index.js`
- Game automatically transitions to round break when:
  - All non-host players answer correctly, OR
  - Timer runs out
- Properly tracks `playersAnswered` array per round

### 4. Title Update

- Applied to all game pages with dark overlay for readability

### 6. Improved Spacing and Margins
- **Files**: `client/src/components/GameBoard.jsx`, `client/src/components/WaitingRoom.jsx`
- Increased padding from `p-6`/`p-8` to `p-8`/`p-10` throughout
- Increased gap spacing from `gap-6`/`gap-8` to `gap-8`/`gap-10`
- Better visual breathing room on all components
- Updated round display to show "Round X/6" instead of "Round X/3"

### 7. Backend URL Configuration
- **Files**: 
  - `client/.env.production` (new)
  - `client/.env.development` (new)
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Production backend: https://finance-drawing-game-production.up.railway.app
- Development backend: http://localhost:3000
